# Obstacle Avoidance Robotic Vehicle using Ultrasonic Sensors

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a robotic vehicle capable of autonomously navigating while avoiding obstacles in its path. The vehicle is equipped with ultrasonic sensors for real-time detection of obstacles, and a micro-controller is utilized to control its movements.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to create a smart vehicle that can:

- Detect obstacles in its vicinity using ultrasonic sensors.
- Navigate around obstacles to ensure a smooth path toward a target area.
- Utilize computational intelligence to pre-calculate obstacle-free routes and make real-time decisions while moving.
